# 0x00. Advanced HTML

# Welcome
Welcome to the Web Stack specialization. The 3 first projects will give you all basics of the Web development: HTML, CSS and Developer tools.

In this project, you will learn how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling - don’t worry, the final page will be “ugly” it’s normal, it’s not the purpose of this project.

Important note: __details are important!__ lowercase vs uppercase / wrong letter… be careful!
